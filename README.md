# GitHubFollowingHack


## Getting Started

# CODE REMOVED

## ~~What's next?~~
~~Current speed: 12 following / sec (43,000 / hour), it is easy to get 300k following but to scale up to 10 million following this is slow.~~


### ~~NEXT To-Do:~~
~~scale up? 10 million following target (crawler? hashmap? Search tree? Github API?)~~


### THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED (deprecated)
